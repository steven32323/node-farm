Finished project Node Farm - part 1 of Jonas Schmedtmann's Node, Express and MongoDB Udemy course.

** Utilised modules such as fs, http and url.
** replaced static html code with dynamic code to allow the project to scale properly as more items are added.
\*\* created a custom module to replace the html template code, allowing the module to be reused in other modules and making the index.js file leaner.
